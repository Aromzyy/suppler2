            <h2>How does the app detect skin conditions?</h2>
            <p>
                Our app uses advanced machine learning algorithms trained on a diverse dataset of skin conditions. By analyzing images of the skin condition, it predicts possible conditions based on patterns recognized during its training.

            <h2>Is the app accurate?</h2>
            <p>
                While our app is highly accurate and continuously improving, it's designed to offer preliminary information and cannot replace a professional medical diagnosis. We recommend consulting with a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis.

            <p>
                Simply upload a clear picture of the affected skin area through our app. The machine learning model will analyze the image and provide you with a list of possible conditions, including information about them.
